This project involved leveraging SQL to extract valuable insights from the dataset, aiming to uncover growth opportunities and provide strategic recommendations to enhance BMW’s market penetration in the competitive EV sector.

Project Objectives:

Analyze Regional Sales Trends: Understand how BMW’s EV sales are performing across various regions.

Discover Customer Preferences: Analyze customer demographics and preferences to identify trends in EV purchases.
Competitor Analysis: Compare BMW’s EV performance with competitors to assess market positioning.
Growth Opportunities: Uncover regions with high potential interest for targeted marketing and expansion.

Key Insights:

Top Sales Regions: Identified regions with strong sales performance, providing actionable insights for focused marketing efforts.
Best-Selling Models: Analyzed model-wise sales to pinpoint the EV models contributing the most to BMW’s success.
Market Positioning: Competitor analysis helped assess BMW's position relative to other key players in the EV space.
Customer Demographics: Uncovered patterns in customer preferences, helping BMW tailor its marketing strategies to better meet consumer demands.

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of BMW's presence in the EV market and offers data-driven strategies to improve market penetration and customer engagement.
